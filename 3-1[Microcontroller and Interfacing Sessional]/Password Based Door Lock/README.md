Name of the Project: **Password Based Door Lock Syatem**

Description:
 - First, a welcome message will be shown on the screen.
 - 2 options will be given:

        (1) log-in
        (2) Sign-up/Change Password

`1808031` is the initially set password. The door will open after entering the right password. If a wrong password is entered then the program will prompt the user to try again. If the user fails 3 times the system will be locked for 60 seconds.
